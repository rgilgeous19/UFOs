 ## Summary
 
    - One drawback of this website is that is not show any proof of these UFO sightings. There are no pictures, articles 
      or witness statments to verify the credibility of these sightings.
      
    - For further development, we should not put these sightings on the website until it is proven to be credible and 
      there should be evidence attached.
